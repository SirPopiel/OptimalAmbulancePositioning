# OptimalAmbulancePositioning
Bachelor thesis project. Aim: find an optimal positioning for ambulances in the city of Milan using linear programming models. 
Then, analyze the dynamical properties of the models through a simulation (and try one recollocation model).

Simply run one model in order to get the positioning of the ambulances that are optimal for the model.
In order to plot the ambulances' position and the related coverage the Matlab code has to be run.
